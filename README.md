# DeepTrade Roadmap

This roadmap contains all the tweaks, improvements and new features we plan for DeepTrade. Of course, things change and we may shuffle priorities at any time. At SamurAI/DeepTrade we learn A TON from talking to users, so don't hesitate to contact us with your ideas and feedback.

Check the [Kanban board in this project](https://github.com/orgs/SamurAi-sarl/projects/1) for an overview.
